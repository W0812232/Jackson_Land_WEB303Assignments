            <button class="accord-label">Early Life</button>
            <div class="accord-panel"><p>Benjamin Reichwald was born 9 April 1994 in Stockholm,
                 Sweden and was raised mainly in the Skanstull area. It was here where, in 2004, 
                 he met Zak Arogundade, also known as Ecco2K. The two were classmates and formed a punk 
                 band named Krossad (Swedish for 'crushed') when Reichwald was 13, which led to Reichwald's 
                 interest in music. After leaving school, Reichwald began to get into making music whilst 
                 working at a daycare centre.</p></div>

            <button class="accord-label">Music Career part 1</button>
            <div class="accord-panel"><p>Reichwald released a few tracks in 2011 under the name Ken Burns,
                but properly began releasing music in 2012. He eventually became friends with Swedish rapper 
                Yung Lean, who was a friend of Reichwald's brother. Reichwald eventually sent a message to 
                Sad Boys member Yung Sherman on SoundCloud, asking to collaborate, which resulted in a working 
                relationship between his own Gravity Boys collective and Lean's Sad Boys Entertainment. Reichwald 
                and Lean then made "Heal You // Bladerunner" from Lean's Unknown Death 2002 mixtape, which gave 
                him attention from Lean's fanbase.

                Reichwald released his debut mixtape, Gluee in 2014 on the YEAR0001 label which was described as the 
                "summertime anthem for a suburban generation stuck scrolling through Twitter." The mixtape was 
                successful on the audio distribution platform SoundCloud, racking up over 2 million plays. This 
                mixtape, coupled with several singles going viral and features on Yung Lean's debut mixtape Unknown 
                Death 2002 was able to rocket Bladee into underground hip hop fame.
                
                Reichwald released his debut album, Eversince on 25 May 2016. The album received mixed reviews 
                from mainstream outlets, but was well received by underground and experimental critics. In 2017, 
                Reichwald teamed up with production group Working on Dying to release his second mixtape, named after 
                the group. The next year, his second album, Red Light, released.
                
                Reichwald's third mixtape, Icedancer, was released 28 December 2018. This album was executively 
                produced by Australian collective Ripsquadd featuring production from Whitearmor and PJ Beats. In April 2020, 
                Reichwald released EXETER, a nine-song album he recorded whilst in Gotland with Gud. It is the first Bladee 
                project produced by Gud on the YEAR0001 label.

            <div class="accord-panel"><p>
                In July 2020, Reichwald released his fourth album and second project of 2020, 333 via YEAR0001. The album was 
                produced primarily by Whitearmor, with additional production coming from close collaborators Gud, Mechatok, 
                and Lusi (Ripsquadd member), as well as Joakim Benon of the Swedish band JJ. Notable is the absence of any vocal 
                features, especially of longtime collaborator and fellow Drain Gang member Ecco2K, who contributed to the previous 3 Bladee albums.
                
                In December 2020, Reichwald released his third and final project of 2020, a collaborative album with the producer Mechatok 
                entitled Good Luck via YEAR0001. Both Reichwald and Mechatok performed all of the tracks on the album as well as an additional 
                set from Mechatok in a livestreamed performance on 10 December, the same day the album was released.
                
                In May 2021, Reichwald released his fifth solo album, The Fool via YEAR0001. The album was executively 
                produced by frequent collaborator Lusi.
                
                In January 2022, Reichwald released the single Amygdala in collaboration with Ecco2k and Mechatok. 
                That same year, a collaborative project, Crest, with Ecco2K was released via YEAR0001 in March. The project was recorded in spring 2020.
                
                On 30 September 2022, Reichwald released Spiderr. In January 2023, Bladee featured on the Skrillex
                 song Real Spring. Seven months later in August 2023, he released the songs Victorious and Bullets with Yung Lean.</p></div>

            <button class="accord-label">Art and Fashion Career</button>
            <div class="accord-panel"><p>In July 2018, Reichwald and fellow Drain Gang member Ecco2K walked
                Alyx Studio's S/S 2019 menswear show in Paris, on invitation from 
                Matthew Williams. During July and August 2021, Reichwald exhibited his 
                first solo collection of paintings Real Sprin9 at the Residence Gallery 
                in London. In September 2021, Reichwald released a capsule Drain Gang 
                collection in collaboration with the American-Swedish clothing brand GANT.
                In 2023, Reichwald collaborated with fellow Swedish artist Jonas Rönnberg
                (Varg2™) for their first art exhibition, "Fucked for Life," held at The 
                Hole in New York.[35] The exhibition featured a series of unique paintings, 
                merging traditional and contemporary art styles, created using both traditional 
                and unconventional tools. The artistic process mirrored their collaborative 
                approach in music, with the paintings reflecting the fleeting moments of 
                the digital age. This venture further established Bladee's multifaceted 
                career in music, visual art, and design.</p></div>

            <button class="accord-label"> Musical Style </button>
            <div class="accord-panel"><p>Reichwald has described his style as "pain" though saying, as of 
                2018, he had "evolved into some sort of auto-tuned dark angel". He often
                experiments, incorporating various genres. He has stated that he finds 
                the process therapeutic. In an interview with Reichwald, Jack Angell,
                a music writer for The Fader, described Reichwald's sound as "frostbitten 
                futurism" and remarked that Reichwald's music evokes "a wide spectrum of 
                emotion". He has received attention for his collaborations and live performances 
                with Yung Lean. Reichwald has cited Chief Keef, Lil B, The Beach Boys,
                Basshunter, and James Ferraro as influences on his work.[</p></div>
